#group means the package that all the classes in this mod are contained in. The root of this source. Example: redgear.geocraft

#The location of the class file that has at least one '@ModVersion@' in a string. 
#At compile-time, the snippit '@ModVersion@' will be replaced with the contents of mod_version.
#This should be a RELATIVE path from the mod_group, and should be delimited with '/' not '.'.
#Do not have a .java at the end. 
#Example: redgear.geocraft.core.Geocraft.java would have redgear.geocraft as it's mod_group and core/Geocraft as it's mod_main

#The version of core to grab from GitHub. Should be both the 'tag' of the commit, as well as the version of core.
#build.gradle uses this for both downloading from GitHub, AND for finding the .jar of core once it's installed, but NOT for placing 
#that .jar in the right place. Core's own build.gradle does that, so the number MUST agree with that. 

#If there isn't a tag for this version, the latest will be downloaded instead.
